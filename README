PROJECT 1 README

run_analysis.R is a R script that satisfies the requirements for the course project for Getting & Cleaning Data at Johns Hopkins University.

Here are the objectives from the course web-site:
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


run_analysis.R is a R script that takes the data downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and creates a tidy data set that contains the average gyroscopic and accelerometer measurements for 30 different subjects and 6 different activities from a experiment decribed here:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

run_analysis.R assumes that you have downloaded and unzipped the data to the following folder:  

(your working directory)/data/Project1/UCI HAR Dataset

If you have done this, please do so before running the code.

CodeBook.Rmd is a markdown file that describes each variable and data frame created by run_analysis.  Additionally, it contains the process for creating the tidy data set, tidy_data.
